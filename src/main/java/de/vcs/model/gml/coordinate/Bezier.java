/**
 * Bezier are polynomial splines that use Bézier or Bernstein polynomials for
 * interpolation purposes. An n-long control point array shall create a polynomial
 * curve of degree n that defines the entire curve segment. These curves are
 * defined in terms of a set of basis functions called the Bézier or Bernstein
 * polynomials.

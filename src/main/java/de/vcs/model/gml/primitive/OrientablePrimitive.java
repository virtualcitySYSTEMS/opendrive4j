/**
 * An orientable primitives (Figure 10) are those that can be mirrored into new
 * geometric objects in terms of their internal local coordinate systems (manifold
 * charts). For curves, the orientation reflects the direction in which the curve
 * is traversed, that is, the sense of its parameterization. When used as boundary
 * curves, the surface being bounded is to the "left" of the oriented curve. For
 * surfaces, the orientation reflects from which direction the local coordinate
 * system can be viewed as right handed, the "top" or the surface being the
 * direction of a completing z-axis that would form a right-handed system. When
 * used as a boundary surface, the bounded solid is "below" the surface. The
 * orientation of points and solids has no immediate geometric interpretation in 3-
 * dimensional space.
 * OrientablePrimitive objects are essentially references to geometric primitives
 * that carry an "orientation" reversal flag (either "+" or "-") that determines
 * whether this primitive agrees or disagrees with the orientation of the
 * referenced object.
 * NOTE There are several reasons for subclassing the "positive" primitives under
 * the orientable primitives. First is a matter of the semantics of subclassing.
 * Subclassing is assumed to be a "is type of" hierarchy. In the view used, the
 * "positive" primitive is simply the orientable one with the positive orientation.
 * If the opposite view were taken, and orientable primitives were subclassed
 * under the "positive" primitive, then by subclassing logic, the "negative"
 * primitive would have to hold the same sort of geometric description that the
 * "positive" primitive does. The only viable solution would be to separate
 * "negative" primitives under the geometric root as being some sort of reference
 * to their opposite. This adds a great deal of complexity to the subclassing tree.
 *  To minimize the number of objects and to bypass this logical complexity,
 * positively oriented primitives are self-referential (are instances of the
 * corresponding primitive subtype) while negatively oriented primitives are not.
 * 
 * Orientable primitives are often denoted by a sign (for the orientation) and a
 * base geometry (curve or surface). The sign datatype is defined in ISO 19103. If
 * "c" is a curve, then "<+, c>" is its positive orientable curve and "<-, c>" is
 * its negative orientable curve. In most cases, leaving out the syntax for record
 * "< , >" does not lead to confusion, so "<+, c>" may be written as "+c" or
 * simply "c", and "<-, c>" as "-c". Curve space arithmetic can be performed if
 * the curves align properly, so that:
 * For c, d : OrientableCurves such that c.endPoint = d.startPoint then
 * ( c + d ) ==: CompositeCurve = < c, d >
